This is a single-page, client-side site. Just host these files with any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages).

## Quick deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new **public** GitHub repo.
2. Upload `index.html` (drag-and-drop).
3. Settings → Pages → "Deploy from branch": select `main` and `/ (root)` → Save.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Quick deploy (Netlify)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com → "Add new site" → "Deploy manually".
2. Drag-and-drop the unzipped folder. Netlify gives you a public URL immediately.
